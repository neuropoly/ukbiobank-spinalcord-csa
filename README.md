# Cord CSA on UK biobank brain MRI database
Measure of the averaged cross-sectional area (CSA) between C2 and C3 of the spinal cord with UK Biobank Brain MRI dataset.
- - -
## Data collection and organization
### Uk Biobank database
The brain MRI data of UK biobank follows the DICOM convention. The spinal cord of the processed brain MRI images is cut off. Because the purpose of this project is to measure the CSA between C2 and C3 of the spinal cord, the raw MRI images for T1w structural images and for T2w FLAIR are used as an input of the pipeline:
 * `T1_orig_defaced.nii.gz`
 * `T2_FLAIR_orig_defaced.nii.gz`

The raw images have gradient distorsion, a distorsion correction will be applied in the analysis pipeline. 

The DICOM dataset is in: `duke:mri/uk_biobank`
### Data conversion: DICOM to BIDS
For this project, a BIDS standard dataset is used. A conversion of DICOM to BIDS is necessary for the UK Biobank dataset. 
The data from the DICOM dataset in the BIDS standard for this project have the following correspondance for each subjects:
 * `T1_orig_defaced.nii.gz` in the BIDS standard is `sub-XXXXXXX_T1w.nii.gz`
 * `T2_FLAIR_orig_defaced.nii.gz` in the BIDS standard is`sub-XXXXXXX_T2w.nii.gz`
 
To convert the DICOM dataset in a BIDS structure for this project, run the following line:
~~~
curate_project.py -path-in <path_DICOM_dataset> -path-output <path_BIDS_dataset>
~~~
The BIDS datset is (for now) in `duke: temp/uk_biobank_BIDS`

Here is an example of the BIDS data structure of UK biobank data:

## Analysis pipeline
This repository includes a collection of scripts to analyse a BIDS-structured MRI dataset.

### Dependencies
MANDATORY:

* [SCT 5.0.1](https://github.com/neuropoly/spinalcordtoolbox/releases/tag/5.0.1) for processing
* [gradunwrap v1.2.0](https://github.com/Washington-University/gradunwarp/tree/v1.2.0) for gradient correction
* Python 3.7  for statistical analysis

OPTIONAL:

* [FSLeyes](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSLeyes) for correcting segmentations

### Installation
Download this repository:
~~~
git clone https://github.com/sct-pipeline/ukbiobank-spinalcord-csa.git
~~~
Install:
~~~
cd ukbiobank-spinalcord-csa
pip install -e ./
~~~
### Note on gradient distorsion correction
A `coeff.grad` associated with the MRI scanner used for the data is necessary if it has not been applied yet. In this project, the gradient distorsion correction is done in `process_data.sh` with [gradunwrap v1.2.0](https://github.com/Washington-University/gradunwarp/tree/v1.2.0) and Siemens `coeff.grad` file.
- - -
### Usage
Create a folder where the results will be generated:
~~~
mkdir ~/ukbiobank_results
~~~
Initialize shell variable with the path to the folder with the `coeff.grad` file:
~~~
PATH_GRADCORR_FILE=<path-gradcorr>
~~~
Launch processing:
~~~
sct_run_batch -jobs -1 -path-data <PATH_DATA> -path-output ~/ukbiobank_results/ -script process_data.sh -script-args $PATH_GRADCORR_FILE
~~~

Or you can launch processing with a config file instead by using the flag `-config` and by adjusting the file `config_sct_run_batch.yml` according to your setups.
See `sct_run_batch -h` to look at the available options. To launch processing:

~~~
sct_run_batch -config config_sct_run_batch.yml
~~~

### Quality control
After running the analysis, check your Quality Control (qc) report by opening the file `~/ukbiobank_results/qc/index.html`. Use the "search" feature of the QC report to quikly jump to segmentations or labeling issues.

#### Segmentation and vertebral labeling
If segmentation or labeling issues are noticed while checking the quality report, proceed to manual segmentation correction or manual labeling of C2-C3 intervertebral disc at the posterior tip of the disc using the procedure below:

1. Create a .yml file that lists the data to correct segmentation or vertebral labeling.
2. In QC report, search for "deepseg" to only display results of spinal cord segmentation, search for "vertebrae" to only display vertebral labeling.
3. Review segmentation and spinal cord labeling, note that the segmentation et vertebral labeling need to be accurate only between C2-C3, for cord CSA. 
4. If *major* issues are detected for C2-C3 segmentation and vertebral labeling, add the image name into the .yml file as in the example below:

~~~
FILES_SEG:
- sub-1000032_T1w_RPI_r_gradcorr.nii.gz
- sub-1000083_T2w_RPI_r_gradcorr.nii.gz
FILES_LABEL:
- sub-1000032_T1w_RPI_r_gradcorr.nii.gz
- sub-1000710_T1w_RPI_r_gradcorr.nii.gz
~~~

* `FILES_SEG`: Images associated with spinal cord segmentation
* `FILES_LABEL` Images associated with vertebral labeling

After completing .yml file list of images to proceed with manual correction, run the following line:
~~~
uk_manual_correction -config <.yml file> -path-in ~/ukbiobank_results/data_processed -path-out <PATH_DATA>
~~~
The script loop through all the files listed in .yml file and opens an interactive window to either correct manually segmentation or vertebral labeling. Each mannually corrected label is saved under `derivative/labels/`folder at the root of `PATH_DATA` according to the BIDS convention. Each manually-corrected file has the suffix `-manual`.

C2-C3 disc label will be located at the posterior tip of the disc as shown in the following image.

#### Upload the manually-corrected files
A QC report of the manually correct files is created in a zip file. To update the database, follow this proceedure:
* Commit and push manually-corrected files (placed in folders under `derivatives/lables/`
* Create a pull request and add qc zip file in the body of the PR. 
* If PR is accepted, a new release of the dataset will be created and the qc zip file will be uploaded as a release object.

#### Re-run the analysis
After all the necessary segmentation and labels are corrected, re-run the analysis (`sct_run_batch`command in **Usage** section). If manually-corrected files exists, they will be used intead of proceeding to automatic segmentation and labeling. Make sure to put the output results in another folder (flag `-path-output`) if you don't want the previous relsults to be overwritten.

### Statistical analysis
#### Generate datafile:
To generate a data file with the CSA results from `process_data.sh` and fields from `participant.tsv`, run the follwing line:

~~~
uk_get_subject_info -path-data <PATH_DATA> -path-output ~/ukbiobank_results/ 
~~~

#### Compute statistical analysis
To compute the statistical analysis of cord CSA results, use `uk_compute_stats`.  If the datafile ouput of `uk_get_subject_info` is not `data_ukbiobank.csv`, add the flag `-dataFile <FILENAME>`. Run this script in `/results` folder or specify path to folder that contains output files of analysis pipeline in with `-path-output` flag. The flag -exclude points to a yml file containing the subjects to be excluded from the statistical analysis:
~~~
uk_compute_stats -path-output ~/ukbiobank_results/ -dataFile <DATAFILE> -exclude <EXCLUDE.yml>
~~~

The output of `uk_compute_stats`has the following data structure:
